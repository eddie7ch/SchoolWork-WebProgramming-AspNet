# Contributing Guide — Zoubera Issaka

Hi Zoubera! This guide will help you get set up and understand what you need to work on.

## Your Branch

Your branch is **`zoubera-dev`**. Always work here — never directly on `main`.

```bash
# Clone the repo (first time only)
git clone https://github.com/bvc-g9-vehicle-rental/Vehicle-Rental-Management-System.git
cd Vehicle-Rental-Management-System

# Switch to your branch
git checkout zoubera-dev
```

## Running the App Locally

You need: [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) + [SQL Server LocalDB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb)

```bash
dotnet run
```

Then open `http://localhost:5254` in your browser.

Or just use the live app: **[https://vehicle-rental-app.azurewebsites.net](https://vehicle-rental-app.azurewebsites.net)**

## How Views Work (quick explanation)

Each page is a `.cshtml` file — it's HTML with some C# mixed in using `@`.

Example from `Views/Vehicle/Index.cshtml`:
```html
@model IEnumerable<VehicleRental.Models.Vehicle>  <!-- data passed from controller -->

<h2>Vehicles</h2>
<table class="table">
    @foreach (var v in Model) {   <!-- loop through vehicles -->
        <tr>
            <td>@v.Make</td>      <!-- output a value -->
            <td>@v.Model</td>
        </tr>
    }
</table>
```

The **controller** fetches data from the database and passes it to the view. You don't need to touch the controllers — just focus on how the data looks in the view.

---

## The Shared Layout

**`Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`** is the master template — the navbar and overall page structure lives here. Every other page is injected into it via `@RenderBody()`. If you want to change the navbar or add something that appears on every page, edit this file.

Bootstrap 5 is already included via CDN in `_Layout.cshtml`.

## What You Can Work On

- Improve the styling of any page in `Views/`
- Make pages more responsive (mobile-friendly)
- Improve the navbar in `_Layout.cshtml`
- Add better form validation messages
- Improve the Dashboard (`Views/Home/Index.cshtml`) layout
- Add success/error alert styling
- Any UI improvements you think would look better

---

## Saving Your Work

```bash
# After making changes
git add .
git commit -m "ui: improve dashboard layout"
git push origin zoubera-dev
```

Use clear commit messages starting with `ui:` or `style:` so it's easy to see what you changed.
